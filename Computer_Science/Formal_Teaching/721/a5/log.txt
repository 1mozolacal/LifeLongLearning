Checking if bigBox1 is in GMC:
?- solve_problem(2, Plan).
Plan = [load(bigBox1, gmc, memorialUnivNewfoundland), drive(gmc, stJohnAirport, memorialUnivNewfoundland, stJohn)]
Yes (0.00s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.02s cpu)


Checking if bigBox1 is at stJohnAirport:
?- solve_problem(3, Plan).
Plan = [drive(gmc, memorialUnivNewfoundland, stJohnAirport, stJohn), load(bigBox1, gmc, memorialUnivNewfoundland), drive(gmc, stJohnAirport, memorialUnivNewfoundland, stJohn)]
Yes (0.05s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)
No (0.24s cpu)

Results Discussion:
For each case, there is only one solution that fits the upper bound of actions, because of this there are no 
redundancies. We had issues where the box would not load as a result of us not properly declaring
a box as a box. However, once we figured that out, the problem solver worked very well.
Tested on an Intel Core i5-8259U.
