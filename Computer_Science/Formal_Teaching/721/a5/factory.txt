Explain why there are so many different solutions and discuss briefly your results (including computation time).

There are different solutions as a result of there being multiple orders 
of non-redundant actions that can lead to the same end state. However, since 
the bound is seven and the minimum number of actions required to reach the 
goal state is also seven, there will be no useless cases in this specific 
scenario. However, given a greater bound, we would get useless cases that 
would be removed by the useless predicate.


Notice if solving planning problems takes more time or less time. Include your testing results and a brief discussion of your results in the factory report.

When using the useless predicate it became significantly faster and 
is able exhaust all pausibilities in under and second (0.70s cpu).
The reason why it is so much faster is because it not long explores
repeatative behaviour.
