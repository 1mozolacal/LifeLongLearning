# Team layout

## Input
This person works on taking input files and extracting the proper information from them. Then convert it into your team's made data structure.  

What has to be communicated with the team? 
> What structure will be return to be used as input in the solution step.
## Data Structure
Often there is clear data types in the challenge. This job is to implment them. Make a construction, setters, getters and a __str__ for easy debugging. 

What needs to be communicated to the team?
> Start off by deciding how the __str__ function will display it and contructor
> Continuously comunicate what function are need and their input/ouputs. Make a file and have the solution team write what they as they need it.
## Ouput
The result has to be formated very specifically. Thus the result from the solution task must be formatted corrected and outputted to a file.

What needs to be communicated to the team?
> Need to know what the input for this will be (in other words what the solution section will return)
## Solution
This is the meat and potatos. With the given input solve the problem and product and output.

What needs to be communicated to the team?
> You need to know what the input will look like.
> How the output will be structured.
