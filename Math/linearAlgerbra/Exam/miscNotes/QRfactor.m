Definition. Let 
 be an 
 matrix with 
 and let 
 be the columns of 
. Apply the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the columns and construct an orthonormal basis 
 of 
. Project the columns onto the basis

 
 
 
where 
 by construction. Write as matrix multiplication

where

 
 
 
Extend the basis to an orthonormal basis 
 of 
 where 
 is any orthonormal basis of the orthogonal complement 
 and let

 
 
Finally, the QR decomposition of 
 is

  
 
 
where 
 is a 
 orthogonal matrix and 
 is a 
 upper triangular matrix. The decomposition 
 is called the thin QR decomposition. See Wikipedia:QR decomposition.
